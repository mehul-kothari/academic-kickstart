# Biography
I am a first-year graduate student at UC Irvine, pursuing my masters in Computer Science. I am going to be graduating in Dec 2019. I am looking forward to having a career in software engineering. Looking at my past experiences, I have got the opportunity to work at three companies as a software developer intern. Taking up internships in various domains of software development has helped me get an overall experience in different areas of the field. Experiences ranging from developing a java app using the Spring framework to getting hands-on experience with chatbots has not only been a learning curve but also a lot of fun. I love working on challenging problems and try to find more than one way to solve it.

I have even got the opportunity to work on projects inside and outside academia. Applications ranging from a standalone java application to an android app to even a full stack Web application. Currently, I am trying to venture into fields such as distributed systems, Data Science and Systems. I have recently started working on the xv6 kernel and trying to modify and play around with it to the best of my needs.
