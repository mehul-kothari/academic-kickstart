abstract = "This paper overviews different algorithms used in blink detection. The various phases in this system are image capture, face detection, eye localization and finally blink detection. The standard algorithms for each phase have been discussed. We have proposed a method for blink detection using convolutional neural network to detect the eye states and predict the blinks. Finally, a comparison of our method is made to the other methods of detecting blinks in both still images and live video feed scenarios."
